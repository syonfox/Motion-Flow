# Motion Flow
##### By: Kier Lindsay, Rafid Ashab Pranta

## Introduction

Motion flow is a game in which, we attempt to create a interesting arcade game and
experimented to control the game using machine learning models that detects human body pose.  The players skies through randomly generated
terrain and the objective of the game is travel the farthest and collect as much
point as possible before night falls. 

###Technology used
The game is build with in C++ with SFML Library, Thor Library and IMgui Library. 
//the game has it's own physics engine? 

The pose detection of the player is achieved with using OpenPose model created by CMU-Perpetual-Computing-Lab, Opencv
Libraries and Google Cloud services.


### Concept
#### Game Concept
The game concept started as a ski game where the player would ski down a
slope taking jumps and possibly tricks.  This idea took inspiration from
Altos Adventure.  After woring on the intital sole mehanics and getti //

### Motivation

The goal was to use machine learning to analyze human body pose or hand gesture and serve it as the controller for the game.
and multiple people can play at the same time on the same computer using split screen since they only need to do certain 
body poses to play the game.
